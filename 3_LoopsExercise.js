// Week 2 - Loops

// In the following exercises, you will need to place your code or answer underneath each
// exercise prompt.

// First try answering these without using references or looking up any information.
// Then, check your answer by using references and/or running your code.
// You can run your JS code using the Chrome or Firefox Developer tools, or by using Node.js.
// Feel free to update your answers if you got them wrong at first -- this exercise is for your own learning.
// But make sure you understand why the correct answer is right.

// Exercise 1. Write a 'while' loop that prints the integers (whole numbers)
// between 1 and 5 (inclusive).
/*
const arr1 = [];

let i = 1;

while (i <= 5) {
    arr1.push(i);
    i++;
}

console.log(arr1);

// Exercise 2. Write a 'do while' loop that prints the integers (whole numbers)
// between 1 and 5 (inclusive).
const arr2 = [];

let j = 1;

do {
    arr2.push(j);
    j++;
} while (j <= 5);

console.log(arr2)

// Exercise 3. Write a 'for' loop that prints the integers (whole numbers)
// between 1 and 5 (inclusive).
const arr3 = [];

for (let k = 1; k <= 5; k++) {
    arr3.push(k);
}

console.log(arr3); 
*/

// Exercise 4. Now we want a loop that prints the integers
// counting DOWN from 10 to 1 (inclusive). Write three loops that do this, to practice
// writing loops in all 3 ways -- as a 'while', 'do while', and 'for' loop.

/*
const arr1 = []
let i = 10;

while (i >= 1) {
    arr1.push(i);
    i--;
}

const arr2 = [];
let j = 10;

do {
    arr2.push(j);
    j--;
} while (j >= 1)

const arr3 = [];

for (let k = 10; k >=1; k--) {
    arr3.push(k)
}

console.log(arr3)
*/

// Exercise 5. Write a loop that prints the integers from 7 to 27. Write this
// loop in all 3 ways -- as a 'while', 'do while', and 'for' loop.
/* 
const arr1 = [];
let i = 7;

while (i <= 27) {
    arr1.push(i);
    i++;
}
console.log(arr1);

const arr2 = [];
let j = 7;

do {
    arr2.push(j); 
    j++;
} while (j <= 27);
console.log(arr2);

const arr3 = [];

for (let k = 7; k <= 27; k++) {
    arr3.push(k);
}
console.log(arr3);
*/

// Exercise 6. Write a loop that prints numbers between 0 and 100, counting by tens.
// I.e. it will print 10, then 20, then 30, etc.
// Write this loop in all 3 ways -- as a 'while', 'do while', and 'for' loop.

const arr1 = []
let i = 0;

while (i <= 100) {
    arr1.push(i);
    i+=10;
}
console.log(arr1);

const arr2 = [];
let j = 0;

do {
    arr2.push(j);
    j+=10;
} while (j <= 100);
console.log(arr2)

const arr3 = [];

for (let k = 0; k <= 100; k+=10) {
    arr3.push(k);
}
console.log(arr3);


// Exercise 7. Add a comment as to why the following loop is an infinite loop (will
// run without ever stopping). Then fix the loop so that it stops when
// counterFour is equal to -100.

let counterFour = 1;
while (counterFour > -100) {
  console.log("HELP ME!");
  counterFour--;
}
// this is an infinite loop because counterFour is already less than 2, and if it just keeps 
// decrementing it will go through all the negative numbers without stopping.

// Exercise 8. Make a variable that contains your favorite integer. Write a loop
// (your choice which type) that prints the integers from 0 to that number.

const faveNumber = [];
const mine = 721;
let n = 0;

while (n <= mine) {
    faveNumber.push(n);
    n++;
}

console.log(faveNumber);

// Exercise 9. Make a variable that contains your favorite integer (this time make sure it's
// less than 100). Write a loop (your choice which type) that prints the integers from 0 to 100.
// Next to each number it should print "not my favorite number". But next to your favorite
// number it should print "my favorite number!". Example output (if your favorite number was 2):
// 0 not my favorite number
// 1 not my favorite number
// 2 my favorite number!
// 3 not my favorite number
// ...
// (Hint - use an if statement in your loop)

const myNumber = 27;

for (let m = 0; m <= 100; m++) {
    
    if (m === myNumber) {
        console.log(`${m} my favorite number!`);
    } else {
        console.log(`${m} not my favorite number`);
    }
}


// Exercise 10. In some of the exercises above, we had you write all 3 types of loops, for practice.
// But in real life, how would you decide which type of loop to use? You might not have an
// exact answer, but spend a few minutes thinking about the different types of loops and/or
// doing some research and write down your thoughts in a comment below:

// I know I just used a for loop, because that seemed like the most logical approach to then use a nested if
// statement. So the while loop says, loop through this code only while this statement is true, and the do while
// loop says, do the loop once then test to see if it's true, then loop if it is. in my brain they seem very similar 

// Exercise 11. Now we'll practice using nested loops (a loop inside another loop)!
// Update the nested loops below to so that for each value of outsideCounter,
// the inside loop will show a countdown

/*
counting down from 0
*********************************** 
counting down from 1
inside 1
*********************************** 
counting down from 2
inside 2
inside 1
*********************************** 
counting down from 3
inside 3
inside 2
inside 1
*********************************** 
*/

// I figured this out by toying with the typical structure of a for loop, knowing it needed to increment, etc.
// maybe it's just the context of the example, but even though I solved it, I'm not 100% clear on how the inner loop is working

// on second thought, after reading through the loops again, I think I understand it

for (let outsideCounter = 0; outsideCounter <= 3; outsideCounter++) {
    console.log("counting down from", outsideCounter);
    for (let insideCounter = outsideCounter; insideCounter > 0; insideCounter--) {
      console.log("inside", insideCounter);
    }
    console.log("***********************************");
  }

// Congrats, you made it to the end!
// Did you find this easy or hard? If you used references, which ones helped you?
// Please answer in a comment below.
// I don't know why, but my brain totally froze up when I saw the first couple exercises, so
// I went back to freeCodeCamp and refreshed my memory on loops. I know that out of all the basic concepts, 
// loops have been the trickiest thing for me to grasp but this was really good practice!
